# Motivation
_This section explains why the project exists. What problem(s) is it hoping to address?_

# Goals
_What are the desired capabilities of the technology? How can someone know if the project is helping to address the problem(s)?_

# Usage
_This section provides an overview of the current status of the technology associated with the project. It should include screenshots for all implemented screens of the app. Provide descriptive text with each screenshot and build a narrative. (This section will get progressively more detailed with each release of your app.)_

# Installation
_This section should provide a link to the repo containing your code, and instructions on how to install and run it. (At this point, itâ€™s basically just download and invoke flutter run. Later, when there is a backend database, these instructions will become more complicated. Some projects may also need people to obtain API keys if you are using third party services such as Google Maps or weather services.) Note that your repo, at this point, should be public._

# Development status
_This section should provide a link to your Project Board._

# About us
_This section should introduce all of the team members._
