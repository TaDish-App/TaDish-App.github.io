# Installation
_This section should provide a link to the repo containing your code, and instructions on how to install and run it. (At this point, it’s basically just download and invoke flutter run. Later, when there is a backend database, these instructions will become more complicated. Some projects may also need people to obtain API keys if you are using third party services such as Google Maps or weather services.) Note that your repo, at this point, should be public._

1. Install Flutter and Dart
2. Clone TaDish Repository [here](https://github.com/HACC-Camino/HACC-Camino)
3. Change directory (cd) into the TaDish parent directory
4. Run the application by typing ```flutter run```
